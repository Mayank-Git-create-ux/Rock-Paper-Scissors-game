Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
A dynamic and interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with Flask for the backend and a responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. This project features engaging animations and consistent image assets for a smooth user experience.

Features
Flask Backend: Handles game logic, including determining the winner of each round.

Responsive Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling), and JavaScript, ensuring a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Dynamic Animations:

Symbols (Rock, Paper, Scissors) visually approach each other before the outcome.

Specific animations depict the winning action (e.g., scissors cutting paper, paper covering rock, rock breaking scissors).

A subtle shake animation for a draw.

The winning symbol remains prominently displayed after the animation, or both for a draw.

Image Assets: Uses stable image URLs for Rock, Paper, and Scissors symbols to ensure consistent display across different systems and browsers, avoiding potential emoji rendering issues.

Local Setup and Running
Follow these steps to get the game running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.

pip (Python package installer).

1. Clone the Repository (or create files)
First, get the project files. If you've been working directly, ensure you have app.py, templates/index.html, requirements.txt, and Procfile in a single directory.

If it's in a Git repository, clone it:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd rock-paper-scissors-game # Or your project folder name

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows

3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Flask Application
Once dependencies are installed, you can run the Flask app:

python app.py

You should see output similar to this:

 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit

5. Access the Game
Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided in the terminal (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000).

Deployment to Render.com
This game can be easily deployed to Render, a cloud platform for hosting web services.

1. Ensure Git Repository
Make sure your project files (app.py, templates/, requirements.txt, Procfile, README.md) are committed and pushed to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

# If not already initialized
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for Rock Paper Scissors game"
git branch -M main # Set default branch to 'main'
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main

2. Create a Web Service on Render
Go to https://render.com/ and sign in.

Click "New" -> "Web Service".

Connect your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) and select the repository containing your game.

Configure the service settings:

Name: Give your service a unique name (e.g., rock-paper-scissors-game).

Region: Choose a region geographically close to your target users.

Branch: Specify the branch you want to deploy (e.g., main).

Root Directory: Leave this blank if app.py, requirements.txt, and Procfile are in the root of your repository.

Runtime: Render should auto-detect "Python 3".

Build Command: Render usually auto-detects pip install -r requirements.txt. If not, enter it.

Start Command: Render usually auto-detects gunicorn app:app from your Procfile. If not, enter it.

Plan Type: Select "Free" for a basic deployment.

Click "Create Web Service".

Render will now automatically build and deploy your application. You can monitor the progress in the Render dashboard's logs. Once the deployment is successful, Render will provide you with a public URL where your game will be live!
